First post here! Decided to make a blog or a place for my resume to keep track of my career. 

It was pretty annoying to set up because on M1 macbook, there's a default older ruby version. I've tried using brew to install a newer version and even tried to change the path for it in ~/.zprofile, but at the end of the day, it was riddled with complciations. The ruby that brew installed is a keg (not sure what it means), but I had to result in using a dedicated ruby installed (RVM) to install it, and an older version of OpenSSL 1.1. 

The way that this static website is generated is very similar to developer.vmware.com's structure. I think the developer website is more abstract, but nonetheless, they are very similar. Interesting!
