Hey! My name is Jiajun or JJ for short. 

I'm currently a software engineer working at Clear on the cloud networking infrastructure team. I like complaining (not in a bad way) and then trying to see if I can do anything about it. I enjoy being a software engineer because it's never boring since there's always something to learn!

Outside of work, I like to dabble in different things, and try out new things in life because life is all about experiences!
