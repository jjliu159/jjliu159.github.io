I'm currently a software engineer working at VMWare/Broadcom on the developer experience team! I like complaining (not in a bad way) and then trying to see if I can do anything about it.

I would say, I don't regret being a software engineer because it's never boring since there's always something to learn.

Outside of work, I like to dabble in different things, and try out new things in life because life is all about experiences! 

With that being said, I have lots of past and current hobbies because I have always wanted to try them out! Some of them are:

Past Hobbies:
1. Muay Thai
2. BJJ
3. Pottery
4. Painting

Current Hobbies:
1. Gaming
2. Snowboarding
3. Piano

I also have a huge bucket list, like race tracking as a hobby with a nice car, glamping, and so on.
