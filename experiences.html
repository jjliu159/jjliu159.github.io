      <span class="project-timeline">Software Development Engineer II<br />March 2025 - Present</span>
      <p>I just started this job, but I'm on the cloud networking team. It's a small infrastructure team, but we handle a lot of things, like ALOT. In a nut shell, I handle IaC and AWS networking things.</p>
      <p>I'm still very amazed about the depth of AWS, and especially at scale.</p>

      <h2>Taiki - YC W24</h2>
      <span class="project-timeline">Software Engineer<br />March 2024 - Present</span>
      <p>When I have time, I help out because I genuinely find it fun building things, having more responsbility, and
        learning new things. I really liked learning about authentication, how it works and different methods of
        implementing it. AI definitely helped me a lot with this.</p>
      <p>I helped build the frontend with React, some backend through async Python, and some infra with CI/CD and AWS.</p>

      <h2>Lowe's</h2>
      <span class="project-timeline">Software Engineer<br />May 2024 - May 2025</span>
      <p>I was on the compute platform team, provided Kubernetes-as-a-service through GCP on GKE to almost all
        of Lowe's, including Lowe's.com.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I worked with automation, sometimes I worked with APIs, sometimes I upgraded clusters or
        components, think istio. Yeah, I bounce around a lot.</p>
      <P>There are times where I touched CI/CD toolings like ArgoCD and Argo Workflow, or even Telemtry tools.</P>
