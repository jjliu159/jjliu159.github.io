      <p>When I have time, I help out because I genuinely find it fun building things, having more responsbility, and
        learning new things. I really liked learning about authentication, how it works and different methods of
        implementing it.</p>
      <p>I helped build the frontend with React, and some parts of the backend code through async Python.</p>
